# Operation Pancake — Authoritative Handoff

State revision: 25
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Mission ID: OP-CATALOG-001

## Mission
Obtain a permitted current CFB27 exact-card catalog or delta, import missing exact-card versions without replacing older versions, and revalidate current Top 5 and Best Value results on unchanged scoring models.

## Mandatory SOP
MAP → HISTORY → RESEARCH → CAPABILITIES → PLAN → EXECUTE → ADAPT → VERIFY → UPDATE MAP → CONTINUE

## Start-of-session rule
Read `docs/OPERATION_PANCAKE_CONTROL_STATE.json` first and validate it before making a consequential Pancake decision.
Do not let the newest obstacle replace the recorded mission.

## Preflight evidence
- MAP: OBSERVED: revision 24 / 8353905c is live, clean and READY for OP-CATALOG-001. | OBSERVED: immutable issue #60 reached brokered physical acceptance and failed with WinError 5 replacing server.py.r24.tmp over live server.py. | OBSERVED: rollback preserved original server SHA bd2be607..., pending release state, protected data, and validated temp postimage SHA f073dfe2.
- HISTORY: VERIFIED_HISTORY: revision 24 was broker-created, published as PR #59, passed SOP Gate, merged at 8353905c and rebound READY. | VERIFIED_HISTORY: issues #58 and #60 are terminal and may not be replayed. | VERIFIED_HISTORY: denied raw routes, provider-email rejection, unchanged scoring/exact-card identity and persistent 429 lock remain preserved.
- RESEARCH: OBSERVED: revision-24 patch_installed_server hash-validates server.py.r24.tmp then calls os.replace while the live server is still running; only afterward does run() restart the server. | OBSERVED: server.py is not read-only and the user ACL is full; exact pre/post hashes are correct, isolating the failure to Windows live replacement ordering. | OBSERVED: existing restart_server already has exact-listener stop plus accepted dynamic-port relaunch mechanics; split stop/start is the narrow evidence-grounded repair.
- CAPABILITIES: OBSERVED: revision-24 Gateway/Broker and durable worker are healthy and authorized all prior controlled stages. | OBSERVED: a four-path revision-25 patch can change only action ordering, focused tests, authority and canonical handoff. | OBSERVED: no user action, paid service, scoring change, catalog collection or source-access retry is required.

## Accepted — do not reopen without materially new evidence
- accepted-sop-order: Operation Pancake SOP order is MAP -> HISTORY -> RESEARCH -> CAPABILITIES -> PLAN -> EXECUTE -> ADAPT -> VERIFY -> UPDATE MAP -> CONTINUE.
- accepted-dynamic-port: Simple Evaluator uses the accepted dynamic localhost-port startup architecture; no fixed port is canonical.
- accepted-browser-watch: Original 3U Browser Watch production acceptance is closed and must not be reopened without a new regression.
- accepted-two-layer-control-standard: Operation Pancake behavior control requires both a ChatGPT instruction layer and a fail-closed controlled execution layer; neither alone satisfies the objective.
- accepted-provider-contact-approval: External provider messages, paid access, or account creation for catalog acquisition require explicit user approval before execution.
- accepted-authoritative-history-route-guard: Consequential strict decisions must independently load structured REQUIRED_NEXT/REJECTED route constraints from the project authority; caller-supplied history cannot omit or override them.
- accepted-existing-catalog-acquisition-route: OP-CATALOG-001 may use historically established public unauthenticated CFB.FAN acquisition methods already present in the repository: the bulk player-items adapter when reachable and the fixed public-player-page CfbFanPublicAdapter. Both remain bounded by existing conservative rate, provenance, validation, and fail-closed rules; no bypass or evasion is authorized.

## Rejected/superseded — do not retry without materially new evidence
- reject-hardcoded-8788: Hard-code 127.0.0.1:8788 as the Simple Evaluator port.
- reject-replacement-launcher: Invent a replacement launcher/runtime merely because an existing component is inconvenient.
- reject-opera-mission-drift: Treat an Opera connector failure as a new mission or as proof the overall decision-control effort is blocked.
- reject-desktop-commander-retry: Retry or recheck Desktop Commander before its allowance is restored.
- reject-checkpoint-completion: Treat a test, commit, CI run, PR, package, screenshot, or intermediate checkpoint as completion while executable work remains.
- reject-feature-before-control: Resume Simple Evaluator/Price Watch/Training Watch feature work before the overall decision-process control mission is implemented and verified.
- reject-instruction-only-completion: Declare the control problem solved because Project/Custom Instructions exist without mechanical mutation enforcement.
- reject-guess-patch-loop: Create another implementation patch from an unverified root-cause hypothesis or retry a failed hypothesis without materially new evidence.
- reject-user-test-before-exhaustion: Ask the user to install/click/restart/test while legitimate executable technical routes remain.
- reject-provider-email-as-catalog-next-action: Treat the preserved Stormstrike/CFB.FAN provider-email request as the current or only next action for OP-CATALOG-001.
- reject-catalog-access-bypass: Bypass authentication, CAPTCHA, access controls, explicit denial, or rate limits; change identity/rate behavior to evade source restrictions.
- reject-catalog-denied-route-retry: Retry either observed-denied CFB.FAN acquisition request, or change client identity/authentication/cookies/headers/proxy/rate behavior to regain access, without materially new evidence that the denial condition changed.

## Next action
Deploy the minimal revision-25 Windows stop-before-replace correction through the existing Gateway/Broker path, then submit one fresh immutable complete_simple_single_worktab_acceptance request. Issue #60 is terminal. Revision 25 must stop the exact Simple Evaluator listener before replacing the already hash-validated server.py postimage, relaunch only through the accepted dynamic-port launcher, and use the same stop-before-restore order during rollback. Preserve all Revision-24 Browser Helper logic, scoring, exact-card identity, watches, source locks and the persistent RATE_LIMITED value-probe lock.

## Remaining executable work
- Validate revision-25 in an isolated git clone with authority/handoff/self-test and focused tests.
- Obtain fresh Gateway/Broker authorization; create/publish/merge exact revision-25 and rebind the worker.
- Submit a fresh immutable full single-worktab acceptance request; do not replay issue #60.
- Verify stop-before-replace, dynamic relaunch, helper 1.4.13, one-tab dwell/cadence, protected state, evaluator and both restart proofs.
- Continue OP-CATALOG-001 because the five current FS versions still are not imported and catalog criteria remain open.

## Completion rule
A commit, test, CI run, PR, package, screenshot, or progress report is only a checkpoint.
Continue until the user-facing objective is verified, executable work is exhausted, or one genuine external action remains.
