# Operation Pancake — Authoritative Handoff

State revision: 29
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Mission ID: OP-CATALOG-001

## Mission
Obtain a permitted current CFB27 exact-card catalog or delta, import missing exact-card versions without replacing older versions, and revalidate current Top 5 and Best Value results on unchanged scoring models.

## Mandatory SOP
MAP → HISTORY → RESEARCH → CAPABILITIES → PLAN → EXECUTE → ADAPT → VERIFY → UPDATE MAP → CONTINUE

## Start-of-session rule
Read `docs/OPERATION_PANCAKE_CONTROL_STATE.json` first and validate it before making a consequential Pancake decision.
Do not let the newest obstacle replace the recorded mission.

## Preflight evidence
- MAP: OBSERVED: Revision 28 / aaffb31b is merged, deployed and READY for OP-CATALOG-001. | OBSERVED: fresh immutable issue #69 passed request freeze and Gateway/Broker authorization, then failed only in navigate_selected_url because Edge window activation failed at WScript.Shell.AppActivate. | OBSERVED: exact controlled Edge PID 29544 has a valid main window handle/title and was minimized during the failure.
- HISTORY: VERIFIED_HISTORY: issues #60/#62/#64/#66/#69 are terminal and must not be replayed. | VERIFIED_HISTORY: Revision 28 fixed the #66 zero-link readiness boundary and progressed acceptance to the later window-activation step. | VERIFIED_HISTORY: denied source routes, provider-email rejection, exact-card identity, watches, persistent RATE_LIMITED lock, dynamic-port architecture and scoring remain unchanged.
- RESEARCH: OBSERVED: both WScript.Shell.AppActivate(process id) and AppActivate(window title) returned false for the exact controlled Edge root. | OBSERVED: on the same exact MainWindowHandle, ShowWindow(SW_RESTORE) returned successfully, SetForegroundWindow returned true, and GetForegroundWindow matched the exact target handle. | EXTERNAL_RESEARCH: Microsoft Windows documents foreground restrictions for SetForegroundWindow and SW_RESTORE behavior for restoring minimized windows.
- CAPABILITIES: OBSERVED: the failure is isolated to navigate_selected_url's foreground primitive; the existing exact process/window selector and all downstream UI Automation remain available. | OBSERVED: Revision-29 can replace only AppActivate with bounded exact-handle ShowWindow/SetForegroundWindow/GetForegroundWindow verification and add focused regression coverage. | OBSERVED: the existing recorded-chat DecisionProvider route still passes the unchanged strict SOPDecisionGateway and ControlledToolBroker without paid API credits, Work or Codex.

## Accepted — do not reopen without materially new evidence
- accepted-sop-order: Operation Pancake SOP order is MAP -> HISTORY -> RESEARCH -> CAPABILITIES -> PLAN -> EXECUTE -> ADAPT -> VERIFY -> UPDATE MAP -> CONTINUE.
- accepted-dynamic-port: Simple Evaluator uses the accepted dynamic localhost-port startup architecture; no fixed port is canonical.
- accepted-browser-watch: Original 3U Browser Watch production acceptance is closed and must not be reopened without a new regression.
- accepted-two-layer-control-standard: Operation Pancake behavior control requires both a ChatGPT instruction layer and a fail-closed controlled execution layer; neither alone satisfies the objective.
- accepted-provider-contact-approval: External provider messages, paid access, or account creation for catalog acquisition require explicit user approval before execution.
- accepted-authoritative-history-route-guard: Consequential strict decisions must independently load structured REQUIRED_NEXT/REJECTED route constraints from the project authority; caller-supplied history cannot omit or override them.
- accepted-existing-catalog-acquisition-route: OP-CATALOG-001 may use historically established public unauthenticated CFB.FAN acquisition methods already present in the repository: the bulk player-items adapter when reachable and the fixed public-player-page CfbFanPublicAdapter. Both remain bounded by existing conservative rate, provenance, validation, and fail-closed rules; no bypass or evasion is authorized.

## Rejected/superseded — do not retry without materially new evidence
- reject-hardcoded-8788: Hard-code 127.0.0.1:8788 as the Simple Evaluator port.
- reject-replacement-launcher: Invent a replacement launcher/runtime merely because an existing component is inconvenient.
- reject-opera-mission-drift: Treat an Opera connector failure as a new mission or as proof the overall decision-control effort is blocked.
- reject-desktop-commander-retry: Retry or recheck Desktop Commander before its allowance is restored.
- reject-checkpoint-completion: Treat a test, commit, CI run, PR, package, screenshot, or intermediate checkpoint as completion while executable work remains.
- reject-feature-before-control: Resume Simple Evaluator/Price Watch/Training Watch feature work before the overall decision-process control mission is implemented and verified.
- reject-instruction-only-completion: Declare the control problem solved because Project/Custom Instructions exist without mechanical mutation enforcement.
- reject-guess-patch-loop: Create another implementation patch from an unverified root-cause hypothesis or retry a failed hypothesis without materially new evidence.
- reject-user-test-before-exhaustion: Ask the user to install/click/restart/test while legitimate executable technical routes remain.
- reject-provider-email-as-catalog-next-action: Treat the preserved Stormstrike/CFB.FAN provider-email request as the current or only next action for OP-CATALOG-001.
- reject-catalog-access-bypass: Bypass authentication, CAPTCHA, access controls, explicit denial, or rate limits; change identity/rate behavior to evade source restrictions.
- reject-catalog-denied-route-retry: Retry either observed-denied CFB.FAN acquisition request, or change client identity/authentication/cookies/headers/proxy/rate behavior to regain access, without materially new evidence that the denial condition changed.
- reject-issue64-replay: Replay issue #64 or depend on an already-open controlled Edge helper window without materially new evidence.
- reject-issue66-replay: Replay issue #66 or replace the exact Installed extensions condition with an unbounded/generic delay.
- reject-issue69-replay: Replay issue #69 or retry WScript.Shell.AppActivate by PID/title without materially new evidence.

## Next action
Deploy the minimal Revision-29 exact-window foreground correction through the existing Gateway/Broker path, then submit one fresh immutable complete_simple_single_worktab_acceptance request against deployed Revision 29. Do not replay issues #60, #62, #64, #66 or #69. Issue #69 is terminal after Revision 28 progressed into navigate_selected_url and failed solely because WScript.Shell.AppActivate returned false for the exact controlled Edge process while its valid main window was minimized. A bounded read-only probe on that exact handle proved ShowWindow(SW_RESTORE) plus SetForegroundWindow succeeds and GetForegroundWindow returns the exact target handle. Revision 29 must replace only the fragile AppActivate dependency with bounded exact-handle restore/foreground verification, preserving every existing server, helper, one-tab, dwell/cadence, exact-card, protected-state, evaluator, restart, denied-source, persistent RATE_LIMITED and unchanged-scoring guard.

## Remaining executable work
- Publish/merge/rebind the exact Revision-29 four-path foreground correction through fresh Gateway/Broker authorization.
- Submit one fresh immutable full single-worktab acceptance request; do not replay issues #60, #62, #64, #66 or #69.
- Verify exact-window restore/foreground handling, helper 1.4.13, one-tab dwell/cadence, protected state, evaluator and both restart proofs.
- Continue OP-CATALOG-001 because the five current FS versions still are not imported and catalog criteria remain open.

## Completion rule
A commit, test, CI run, PR, package, screenshot, or progress report is only a checkpoint.
Continue until the user-facing objective is verified, executable work is exhausted, or one genuine external action remains.
